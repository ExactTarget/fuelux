# FuelUX

FuelUX is in an early stage of development and is not yet suitable for production use.  The project aims to help web developers integrate, manage, and customize quality frontend libraries and utilities to more efficiently develop, maintain, test, and distribute their projects.  Any improvements or fixes we make to these open source projects will be contributed upstream if they are useful to the rest of the community.

## Technologies Used

We are grateful to the maintainers, contributors, and sponsors of the following technologies which make FuelUX possible.

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (Library for DOM, events, animation, and AJAX)

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) (Modern UI components and interactions)

* [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and [recess](http://twitter.github.com/recess) (Stylesheet definition and management)

* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) and [volo](https://github.com/volojs/volo) (Tools for managing modular JavaScript)

* [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) (Build tool for JavaScript projects)

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

### Important notes
Please don't edit files in the `dist` directory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` directory!

All CSS files are regenerated on every grunt build.  Please modify styles by editing the LESS source and rerunning `grunt`.

While grunt can run the included unit tests via PhantomJS, this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.

### Installing grunt
_This assumes you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed already._

1. Test that grunt is installed globally by running `grunt --version` at the command-line.
1. If grunt isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt` to install the latest version. _You may need to run `sudo npm install -g grunt`._
1. From the root directory of this project, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

### Installing PhantomJS

In order for the qunit task to work properly, [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/) must be installed and in the system PATH (if you can run "phantomjs" at the command line, this task should work).

Unfortunately, PhantomJS cannot be installed automatically via npm or grunt, so you need to install it yourself. There are a number of ways to install PhantomJS.

* [PhantomJS and Mac OS X](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/02/phantomjs-and-mac-os-x.html)
* [PhantomJS Installation](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation) (PhantomJS wiki)

Note that the `phantomjs` executable needs to be in the system `PATH` for grunt to see it.

* [How to set the path and environment variables in Windows](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
* [Where does $PATH get set in OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard?](http://superuser.com/questions/69130/where-does-path-get-set-in-os-x-10-6-snow-leopard)
