The first is the file that was modified. The second is the current stat object for that file and the third is the previous stat object.\n\nWhen a file is new the previous stat object is null.\n\nWhen watchTree is finished walking the tree and adding all the listeners it passes the file hash (key if the file/directory names and the values are the current stat objects) as the first argument and null as both the previous and current stat object arguments.\n\n<pre>\n  watch.watchTree('/home/mikeal', function (f, curr, prev) {\n    if (typeof f == \"object\" && prev === null && curr === null) {\n      // Finished walking the tree\n    } else if (prev === null) {\n      // f is a new file\n    } else if (curr.nlink === 0) {\n      // f was removed\n    } else {\n      // f was changed\n    }\n  })\n</pre>\n\n### watch.createMonitor(root, [options,] callback)\n\nThis function creates an EventEmitter that gives notifications for different changes that happen to the file and directory tree under the given root argument.\n\nThe options object is passed to watch.watchTree.\n\nThe callback receives the monitor object.\n\nThe monitor object contains a property, `files`, which is a hash of files and directories as keys with the current stat object as the value.\n\nThe monitor has the following events.\n\n* `'created'` - New file has been created. Two arguments, the filename and the stat object.\n* `'removed'` - A file has been moved or deleted. Two arguments, the filename and the stat object for the fd.\n* `'changed'` - A file has been changed. Three arguments, the filename, the current stat object, and the previous stat object.\n\n<pre>\n  var watch = require('watch')\n  watch.createMonitor('/home/mikeal', function (monitor) {\n    monitor.files['/home/mikeal/.zshrc'] // Stat object for my zshrc.\n    monitor.on(\"created\", function (f, stat) {\n      // Handle new files\n    })\n    monitor.on(\"changed\", function (f, curr, prev) {\n      // Handle file changes\n    })\n    monitor.on(\"removed\", function (f, stat) {\n      // Handle removed files\n    })\n  })\n</pre>\n",
