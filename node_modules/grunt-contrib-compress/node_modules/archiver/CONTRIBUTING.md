#### Code Style Guide

* code should be indented with 2 spaces
* single quotes should be used where feasible
* commas should be followed by a single space (function params, etc)
* variable declaration should include `var`, [no multiple declarations](http://benalman.com/news/2012/05/multiple-var-statements-javascript/)

#### Tests

* tests should be added to the nodeunit configs in `tests/`
* tests can be run with `npm test`
* see existing tests for guidance
