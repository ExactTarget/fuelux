  "readme": "# Glob\n\nThis is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`\nlibrary to do its matching.\n\n## Attention: node-glob users!\n\nThe API has changed dramatically between 2.x and 3.x. This library is\nnow 100% JavaScript, and the integer flags have been replaced with an\noptions object.\n\nAlso, there's an event emitter class, proper tests, and all the other\nthings you've come to expect from node modules.\n\nAnd best of all, no compilation!\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar glob = require(\"glob\")\n\n// options is optional\nglob(\"**/*.js\", options, function (er, files) {\n  // files is an array of filenames.\n  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing\n  // was found, then files is [\"**/*.js\"]\n  // er is an error object or null.\n})\n```\n\n## Features\n\nPlease see the [minimatch\ndocumentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more details.\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* \"Globstar\" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n## Glob Class\n\nCreate a glob object by instanting the `glob.Glob` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Glob = require(\"glob\").Glob\nvar mg = new Glob(pattern, options)\n```\n\nIt's an EventEmitter.\n\n### Properties\n\n* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n* `matches` A [FastList](https://github.com/isaacs/fast-list) object\n  containing the matches as they are found.\n* `error` The error encountered.  When an error is encountered, the\n  glob object is in an undefined state, and should be discarded.\n* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There\n  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting.\n\n### Events\n\n* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the\n  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,\n  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches\n  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.\n* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the pattern.\n* `partial` Emitted when a directory matches the start of a pattern, and\n  is then searched for additional matches.\n* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered.\n* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `abort` Stop the search.\n\n### Options\n\nAll the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to\nGlob to change pattern matching behavior.  Additionally, these ones\nare added which are glob-specific, or have glob-specific ramifcations.\n\nAll options are false by default.\n\n* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Since, unlike\n  Minimatch, Glob requires a working directory to start in, this\n  defaults to `process.cwd()`.\n* `root` Since Glob requires a root setting, this defaults to\n  `path.resolve(options.cwd, \"/\")`.\n* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.\n* `follow` Use `stat` instead of `lstat`.  This is only relevant if\n  `stat` or `mark` are true.\n* `nosort` Don't sort the results.\n* `stat` Set to true to stat/lstat *all* results.  This reduces performance\n  somewhat, but guarantees that the results are files that actually\n  exist.\n* `silent` When an error other than `ENOENT` or `ENOTDIR` is encountered\n  when attempting to read a directory, a warning will be printed to\n  stderr.  Set the `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.\n* `strict` When an error other than `ENOENT` or `ENOTDIR` is encountered\n  when attempting to read a directory, the process will just continue on\n  in search of other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error\n  in these cases.\n",
