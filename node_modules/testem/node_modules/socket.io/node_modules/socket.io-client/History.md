  * Tweaking code so it doesn't throw an exception when used inside a WebWorker in Firefox
  * Do not rely on Array.prototype.indexOf as it breaks with pages that use the Prototype.js library.

  * Disabled reconnection on error if reconnect option is set to false

    and changing (skipping) values of self.reconnectionDelay in the newer reconnection.
  * Removed decoding of parameters when chunking the query string.
    This was used later on to construct the url to post to the socket.io server
    for connection and if we're adding custom parameters of our own to this url
    (for example for OAuth authentication) they were being sent decoded, which is wrong.
