What It Is

Syn is a synthetic event library that pretty much handles typing, clicking, moving, and 
dragging exactly how a real user would perform those actions.

Using Syn

You'd use syn to perform functional testing on a JavaScript application.  Check out the demo 
page (3rd link above) for some examples.  To add syn to your page, you have two options:

1. Add each script with script tags

There are 5 scripts to add to your page in the following order:

1. synthetic.js
2. mouse.js
3. browsers.js
4. key.js
5. drag/drag.js

2. Use steal

If you are using StealJS as your dependency loader, just steal.plugins('syn'), and the dependencies 
will be loaded for you.

Running Syn Tests

Load syn/qunit.html in any browser to run all the tests.  Load syn/drag/qunit.html to run the drag tests.
