			<!-- Migration
				================================================== -->
			<div class="bs-docs-section">
				<h1 class="page-header">Migrating from 2.x to 3.0</h1>
				<p class="lead">Fuel UX 3 is not backwards compatible with v2.x. Use this section as a general guide to upgrading from v2.x to v3.x.</p>

				<h2 id="noBundles">Bundled no more</h2>
				<p>In Fuel UX 2.x, Bootstrap was bundled along with the Fuel UX project code, but this is no longer the case.
					We wanted to enable developers to upgrade either library at their own leisure, so we've decoupled the code.
					Fuel UX still has a dependency on Bootstrap, so the developer must be certain to include Bootstrap within
					their project before Fuel UX themselves. For information on how to do this using external script tags or AMD,
					please see our <a href="./getting-started.html#template">Basic Templates</a>.
				</p>

				<h2 id="newBase">Upgraded foundation</h2>
				<p>Fuel UX 3 is built upon Bootstrap 3 rather than Bootstrap 2, which has an improved mobile-first architecture.
					There are many differences between the two versions. Converting your project to use the latest version
					of Bootstrap is one of the larger efforts when migrating to Fuel UX 3. For assistance with this task,
					please visit <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/migration/">Bootstrap's Migration Guide</a>.
				</p>

				<h2 id="directoryStructure">Directory structure</h2>
				<p>The directory structure has changed significantly in this version of Fuel UX:</p>
<pre><code>fuelux/
├── dev/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── fonts/
│   └── js/
├── fonts/
│   └── src/
├── js/
├── less/
├── markup/
├── test/
└── └── markup/
</code></pre>
				<p>Since UMD (Universal Module Definition) is used for our controls, the 'loader.js' file is no longer
					needed for non-AMD users. This means any file within the js directory can be included on the page via
					external script tag or AMD, which is useful for bringing in individual controls.
				</p>

				<h2 id="markupChanges">Markup changes</h2>
				<p>Due to the updated Bootstrap foundation, our controls have had significant changes made to the markup
					required to be functional. It is recommended that all Fuel UX controls within your project are investigated
					and updated as needed. Visit our <a href="./javascript.html">controls</a> page for more information.
				</p>

				<h2 id="new">What's new</h2>
				<p>This table shows the new controls added to Fuel UX 3.</p>
				<div class="table-responsive">
					<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th style="width: 150px;">Control</th>
								<th>Description</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="./javascript.html#infinite-scrolling">Infinite Scroll</a></td>
								<td>Turn any element into an infinite scrolling region with content that loads on demand.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="./javascript.html#loaders">Loader</a></td>
								<td>Animation for visual indication of waiting time that can be customized to have many appearances.
									Replaces the preloader.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="./javascript.html#placards">Placard</a></td>
								<td>Adds a pop-up element to inputs/textareas on focus with additional options for explicit
									accept/cancel actions.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="./javascript.html#repeaters">Repeater</a></td>
								<td>Data viewer with paging, sorting, and searching. Can be easily extended for various
									renderings. Replaces the datagrid.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>

				<h2 id="removed">What's removed</h2>
				<p>The following controls have been removed from Fuel UX 3.</p>
				<div class="table-responsive">
					<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th style="width: 150px;">Control</th>
								<th>Reason</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Datagrid</td>
								<td>This control has been refactored as the <a href="./javascript.html#repeaters">Repeater</a>
									to enable greater data-rendering flexibility.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Preloader</td>
								<td>This control has been refactored as the <a href="./javascript.html#loaders">Loader</a>
									to be more flexible and consistent across browsers while providing a javascript API.
									CSS-only variations may be re-introduced at a later date.
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>

				<h2 id="notes">Additional notes</h2>
				<p>Other changes in v3.0 are not immediately apparent. Here's a partial list:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Events have been namespaced to follow the <code>[eventname].fu.[controlname]</code> format, which is
						different than the previous structure that contained only the <code>[eventname]</code>. This has been
						done to avoid collision with events outside the Fuel UX library. Example event: <code>actionclicked.fu.wizard</code>
					</li>
					<li>While most javascript methods remain the same, there have been some changes, so be cautious of that.</li>
					<li>Images are no longer a part of Fuel UX. The loader control uses font-icons, but everything else
						is all CSS.
					</li>
				</ul>
