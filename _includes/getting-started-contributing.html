  <h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>

  <p class="lead">Stay up to date on the development of Fuel UX and reach out to others in the community with these helpful resources.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Before writing code, we suggest you <a href="https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/issues?state=open">search for issues</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/issues/new">create a new one</a> to confirm where your contribution fits into
    our roadmap.</li>

    <li>In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style, including the following:
      <ul>
        <li>tabs</li>
        <li>clarity over brevity</li>
        <li>declarative markup</li>
        <li>semicolons</li>
      </ul>
      Be sure to add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">grunt</a>.</li>

    <li>Read more about <a href="https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/wiki/Contributing-to-Fuel-UX">contributing to Fuel UX</a></li>

    <li>Please do not edit files in the <code>dist</code> directory, as we generate those files via grunt. Find source code in the respective <code>js</code>, <code>less</code>, and <code>fonts</code> directory.</li>

    <li>While grunt can run the included unit tests via PhantomJS, ensure that you run tests across a variety of browsers and environments. View the test page at <a href="https://localhost:8000/test/">https://localhost:8000/test/</a> in as many of the browsers listed in <code>sauce_browsers.yml</code> as you can before contributing.</li>
  </ul>
