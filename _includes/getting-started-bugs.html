  <p>While we will still maintain the 2.6.x version (bug fixes only), itâ€™s deprecated. The <a href="{{ site.url }}/2.6/">Fuel UX 2.x documentation</a> has moved and a <a href="https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/tree/fuelux2">legacy branch</a> has been created. We'll leave the Fuel UX 2.x branch up and available for the foreseeable future.</p>
